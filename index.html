              Wails is an open source, community driven project. We welcome anyone to join us in
              contributing to the project. This documentation is aimed at anyone wishing to get
              familiar with the project and the development processes.
            </p>
            <p>There are many ways to contribute to the project:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Developing new features</li>
              <li>Fixing bugs</li>

            </ul>
            <p>
              Guides for these have been created in their own sections. Before getting started,
              please introduce yourself in the
              <a href="https://github.com/wailsapp/wails/discussions/1520">Contributing to Wails</a>
              discussion.
            </p>
            <h3 id="developing-new-features">Developing New Features</h3>
            <p>
              We are always keen to add features to Wails and expand on what the project can do. The
              process for adding new features are as follows:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Pick an enhancement ticket with the &ldquo;TODO&rdquo; label. It&rsquo;s preferable
                to select one from the current
                <a href="https://github.com/orgs/wailsapp/projects/1/views/1">Backlog</a>
                but the choice is yours.
              </li>
              <li>
                Before developing, check that the ticket includes the following information:
                <ul>
                  <li>The purpose of the enhancement</li>
                  <li>What is out of scope for the enhancement</li>
                  <li>
                    What platforms the enhancement targets (most features should be cross-platform
                    unless there&rsquo;s a very specific reason)
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                If the ticket does not include this information, feel free to request the
                information from the person who opened the ticket. Sometimes placeholder tickets are
                created and require more details
              </li>
              <li>Comment on the ticket stating if you wish to develop the feature</li>
              <li>
                Clone the repository and create a branch with the format
                <code>feature/&lt;ticket_number&gt;_&lt;ticket_title&gt;</code>
              </li>
              <li>
                New features often require documentation so please ensure you have also added or
                updated the documentation as part of the changes
              </li>
              <li>
                Once the feature is ready for testing, create a draft PR. Please ensure the PR
                description has the test scenarios and test cases listed with checkmarks, so that
                others can know what still needs to be tested.
              </li>
              <li>
                Once all the testing is completed, please update the status of the PR from draft and
                leave a message.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3 id="fixing-bugs">Fixing Bugs</h3>
            <p>The process for fixing bugs are as follows:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Check the current
                <a href="https://github.com/orgs/wailsapp/projects/1/views/1">Backlog</a>
                and select a bug to fix
              </li>
              <li>Before developing, check that the ticket includes the following information:</li>
              <li>The scope of the issue including platforms affected</li>
              <li>
                The steps to reproduce. Sometimes bugs are opened that are not Wails issues and the
                onus is on the reporter to prove that it is a Wails issue with a
                <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example"
                  >minimal reproducible example</a
                >
              </li>
              <li>The output of <code>wails doctor</code></li>
              <li>
                If the ticket does not include this information, feel free to request the
                information from the person who opened the ticket.
              </li>
              <li>Comment on the ticket stating you wish to develop a fix</li>
              <li>
                Clone the repository and create a branch with the format
                <code>bugfix/&lt;ticket_number&gt;_&lt;ticket_title&gt;</code>
              </li>
              <li>
                Once the fix is ready for testing, create a draft PR. Please ensure the PR
                description has the test scenarios and test cases listed with checkmarks, so that
                others can know what still needs to be tested.
              </li>
              <li>
                Once all the testing is completed, please update the status of the PR from draft and
                leave a message.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3 id="testing">Testing</h3>
            <p>
              Testing is vitally important to ensure quality in the project. There are a couple of
              scenarios where testing can really help the project:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Testing if a bug is reproducible on your local system</li>
              <li>Testing PRs to ensure that they work correctly</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              If you chose to test if someone&rsquo;s bug report is reproducible on your local
              system, then feel free to add a comment on the ticket confirming this with the output
              of
              <code>wails doctor</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
              To test PRs, choose a PR to test and check if the PR description has the testing
              scenarios listed. If not, please ask the person who opened the PR to provide that
              list. Once you have determined a valid test scenario, please report your findings on
              the PR.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you ever need more clarity or help on testing, please ask a question in the
              <a href="https://github.com/wailsapp/wails/discussions/1520">Contributing to Wails</a>
              discussion or on slack.
            </p>
            <h3 id="documenting">Documenting</h3>
            <p>
              This website is also the main documentation site for the project. Sometimes this gets
              out of date and needs some slight adjustments. Some of the documentation isn&rsquo;t
              written to the best standards either. Developing documentation is hard and so any
              contribution to this is greatly appreciated. Features without documentation are
              unfinished so to the project, it&rsquo;s <em>as important</em> as the code.
            </p>
            <p>
              We generally do not create tickets for updating documentation so if there is text you
              think should be updated or rephrased then feel free to submit a PR for that. This site
              is in the main repository under the <code>website</code> directory. We use
              <a href="https://docusaurus.io/">Docusaurus</a> to create the site so there is plenty
              of existing documentation and tutorials around to get started.
            </p>
            <p>To set up a local documentation development environment, do the following:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/configuring-npm/install">Install npm</a>
              </li>
              <li><code>cd website</code></li>
              <li><code>npm install</code></li>
              <li><code>npm run start</code></li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              After it has all installed and is running, you should see the site at
              <a href="http://localhost:3000"><code>http://localhost:3000</code></a
              >. Any changes made to the site text will be immediately reflected in the browser.
            </p>
            <h4 id="versioning">Versioning</h4>
            <p>
              We employ a versioning system where we have the &ldquo;latest&rdquo; documentation AKA
              &ldquo;Next Version&rdquo; which has all the changes that have occurred since the last
              release. We also keep the last release documentation as well as the version before
              that.
            </p>
            <p>
              There isn&rsquo;t usually a reason to update released documentation so we don&rsquo;t
              generally update the documents in the <code>versioned_docs</code> or
              <code>versioned_sidebars</code> directories.
            </p>
            <p>
              The &ldquo;next version&rdquo; docs are mainly in
              <code>website/docs</code> with some &ldquo;version independent&rdquo; documents in
              <code>src/pages</code>. Any updates should be made in the
              <code>website/docs</code> directory.
            </p>
            <h4 id="languages">Languages</h4>
            <p>
              The default documents of the Wails project are English documents. We use the
              &ldquo;crowdin&rdquo; tool to translate documents in other languages and synchronize
              them to the website. You can
              <a href="https://crowdin.com/project/wails">join our project</a>
              and submit your translations to make contributions.
            </p>
            <h5 id="add-new-language">Add new language</h5>
            <p>
              If you want to add a new language to the documentation, please follow the prompts to
              <a
                href="https://github.com/wailsapp/wails/issues/new?assignees=&amp;labels=documentation&amp;template=documentation.yml"
                >fill in and submit an Issue</a

            <p>
              A great way to contribute to the project is to help others who are experiencing
              difficulty. This is normally reported as a ticket or a message on the Wails slack
              channel. Even just clarifying the issue can really help out. Sometimes, when an issue
              is discussed and gets resolved, we create a guide out of it to help others who face
              the same issues.
